# automation-scripts
Set of workflow automation scripts based on selenium.

## Preconditions
To run the scripts you need to have Chrome installed (as they're specifically written and tested for chrome).

For windows:
`choco install chromedriver`

For OSX:
`brew install chromedriver`

Make sure you have *chocolatey* installed if you're on Windows or *homebrew* if you're on OSX.

You can, unless you want to enter the details yourself every time store the passwords in the environment:

```
export LOOPIA_USERNAME=xxx
export LOOPIA_PASSWORD=xxx
```
